=== IMPORTANT NOTE ===
Text objects that are supposed to be small are set to a font size of 100 and then scaled down.
This is because when manim renders text with a small font size the text starts looking janky and letter spacing is off.
To bypass this we set thet text to a large font size and scale accordingly.
